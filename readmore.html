                  Our goal is to create engaging, affordable, and powerful
                  solutions that immerse students in STEM through the excitement
                  of building and programming educational robotics kits.
                  Robokalam is on a mission to bring tomorrow’s education here
                  today. We are at the brink of really exciting technologies
                  which we should embrace  and share. The Engineers and
                  Scientists of the INDIA have always been at the forefront of
                  technology and so why not the students?

                  ASHAER Labs gives young people the chance to discover the wide
                  world of robotics through Designing , Building and Learning.
                  These 3 concepts make for a really rich playground for
                  learning. The students work in pairs to overcome challenges
                  and build extraordinary machines. They then sharpen their wits
                  and program the machines to play their challenges against each
                  other. It is a place where we collaborate, we laugh, we learn
                  and we compete.

                    ASHAER Labs envision a world where every student has the
                    opportunity to be inspired by the excitement of hands-on
                    STEM learning and knows the feeling of creating something
                    with technology. We want people of all ages and backgrounds
                    to that creative problem solving is fun and see its
                    importance in shaping a better future.

                  <p>
                    In an age of Robots, IOT & AI, schools & colleges are
                    teaching our children to be redundant. Robotics is gaining
                    momentum in many schools in INDIA as well as worldwide. And
                    while it's important to note that teachers who administer
                    courses in this area should advanced knowledge in
                    programming and other skills, students are reaping huge
                    benefits, not just for the present, but also for the
                    foreseeable AI future.
